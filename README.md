HTML Structure:
The game's foundation was laid with a simple yet effective HTML structure. This included containers for the game interface, user choices, computer choices, and a result display.

CSS was harnessed to create an appealing game interface. Styles were applied to buttons, result displays, and other elements to make the gaming environment visually enticing.

Responsive Design:
The game was designed to be responsive, ensuring an enjoyable gaming experience on devices of all sizes. CSS media queries were employed to adapt the layout gracefully to different screens.

Future Additions:
As with any project, there's room for expansion. Future enhancements could involve adding animations, sound effects, or even integrating a multiplayer mode to elevate the gaming experience.

In summary, the Rock, Paper, Scissors game project was a delightful exploration of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, combining functionality with an engaging user interface to deliver a timeless gaming classic.
